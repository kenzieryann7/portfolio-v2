# Welcome

## Aspiration

I aspire to use programming to help aid learning and further science.

## About Me

I am currently pursuing Computer Science as an undergraduate at Oregon State University. I currently work with OSU Ecampus as a Student Web Developer on their Custom Team. I first became introduced into coding in high school when I joined FIRST (For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology) Robotics. I was the lead programmer who was mostly self-taught. I learned how to work with a team and how to work within deadlines. After this I realized all that you can do with code and it intrigued me. I think this alone as brought usefull skills to use to my advantage in any career.

My involvement in robotics as opened up endless opportunities. It has helped me find my passion in technology. Personally, I believe everyone should know the basics of coding because this knowledge can help the understanding of development in general. All apps and websites have some form of coding. It is all around good knowledge to have. I hope to use my coding experience to help others in ways of making everything easily accessible. Technology helps with everyday life and that is super important to me.

I love to learn and get more experience where I can. Aside from coding, I enjoy the outdoors such as hiking, fishing, and camping. I also am into writing and gaming. The gaming industry has always been an interest. I really enjoy what can be accomplished with AR/VR, especially in a learning environment. I am actually currently in the development process of a simple incremental game that will be web-based.

## Experience

### Work

I have learned Javascript, Jquery, ES6, and React. I have been taught best practices with coding with hands-on experience through this opportunity. I have also learned both the back-end and front-end processes of development. I have worked closesly with CSS using Bootstrap 4 as our main source of CSS design. Within my position at OSU Ecampus, I have learned how team and project management works and what it might look like in a variety of different forms. I am familiar with Github and other similar applications. I currently maintain and create web multimedia resources for courses at OSU.

### Volunteer Work

I have volunteered in a programming workshop with Intel. We worked with girls in middle school teaching them Scratch. Scratch is a block-based visual programming language made to help children understand the fundamentals of coding. I believe that this experience helped me better understand the basics of coding because teaching code brings a different perspective of learning.

My involvement with FIRST Robotics has also brought volunteering opportunities. I worked with our middle school robotics teams with coding help. I helped them in the development process of basic coding and help them indentify issues. I helped teach them about debugging and how to identify coding errors. I also was a volunteer for their competitions affiliated with FIRST, helping all competing teams with code debugging.
