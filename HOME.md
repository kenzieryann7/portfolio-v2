# Welcome

I am currently a Junior at Oregon State University studying Computer Science.

## Aspiration

I aspire to use programming to help and entertain others. 

## Experience

### Work

I have learned Javascript, Jquery, ES6, and React. I have been taught best practices with coding with hands-on experience through this opportunity. I have also learned both the back-end and front-end processes of development. I have worked closesly with CSS using Bootstrap 4 as our main source of CSS design. Within my position at OSU Ecampus, I have learned how team and project management works and what it might look like in a variety of different forms. I am familiar with Github and other similar applications. I currently maintain and create web multimedia resources for courses at OSU.

### Volunteer Work

I have volunteered in a programming workshop with Intel. We worked with girls in middle school teaching them Scratch. Scratch is a block-based visual programming language made to help children understand the fundamentals of coding. I believe that this experience helped me better understand the basics of coding because teaching code brings a different perspective of learning.

My involvement with FIRST Robotics has also brought volunteering opportunities. I worked with our middle school robotics teams with coding help. I helped them in the development process of basic coding and help them indentify issues. I helped teach them about debugging and how to identify coding errors. I also was a volunteer for their competitions affiliated with FIRST, helping all competing teams with code debugging.
